### Service Worker

The service worker (`public/sw.js`) provides:

## Testing

1. **Local Development**:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Open Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers
   - Check if service worker is registered

2. **Production Build**:
   - Run `npm run build`
   - Run `npm start`
   - Test on a mobile device or use Chrome DevTools device emulation

3. **Lighthouse PWA Audit**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse
   - Run PWA audit
   - Should score 100/100 for PWA criteria

## Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure HTTPS (required for service workers in production)
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Icons Not Showing
- Run `npm run generate-icons` to regenerate icons
- Check that files exist in `public/icons/`
- Verify file paths in `manifest.json`

### Splash Screens Not Working
- Run `npm run generate-splash` to regenerate splash screens
- Check that files exist in `public/icons/`
- Verify Apple meta tags in `app/layout.tsx`

## Notes

- Service workers require HTTPS in production (localhost is exempt)
- iOS Safari has limited PWA support compared to Android Chrome
- The app will work offline for cached pages and assets
